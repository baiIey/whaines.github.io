      <p>I am an Experience Designer specializing in interaction and
         prototyping design. Using a creative approach combined with
         user-centered design principles, I want to serve those who
         seek to realize their digital curiosities.</p>
      <p>I have worked for a variety of large to medium-sized clients
         including Sony, Samsung, Toyota, Pearson and various start-ups.
         Working in the advertising and technology industries, I have
         completed projects to re-define product and brand through strategy,
         visuals and code.</p>
